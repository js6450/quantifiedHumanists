# Data Double

## Facebook
* Status: Requested & Downloaded
* Notes:
  * Needed to request my data to be downloaded. Received download link within the hour of request.
  * Had a considerably bigger file size than what I had initially estimated. (1.95 GB)
  * Neatly organized into different categories of user activities. Because I don't use Facebook to it's full extent a number of folders had no entry.
  * Most of the files consited of photos and videos that I had posted.

## Instagram
* Status: Requested & Downloaded
* Notes:
  * Needed to request my data to be downloaded. Received download link within the hour of request.
  * As the app itself is, the file size is considerably smaller than that of facebook and the structure of the files were also a lot simpler.
  * Mostly consists of photos and videos that I had posted.
  * Had more information about my user activity on Instagram than what actually gets displayed on the app itself such as accurate time stamps of all activities.

## iMessage
* Status: Downloaded
* Notes:
  * Used Joey's [ichat2json](https://github.com/joeyklee/ichat2json) to convert the iMessage's chat.db file to JSON.
  * Texts and other text based activities between my friends on iMessage.

## Amazon
* Status: Requested & Downloaded
* Notes:
  * Needed to request my data to be downloaded. Received download link immediately.
  * CSV file of all purchases made through the account with all details regarding the items.

## Reporter
* Status: Downloaded
* Notes:
  * The application itself allows export in CSV and JSON. (JSON file downloaded)
  * JSON file seems to be the most well organized for future use in code.

## Chrome
* Status: Downloaded (but incomplete?)
* Notes:
  * Couldn't figure out a way of downloading browser history data locally and needed to request data download from Google Accounts. Took a couple of hours for to receive the download link.
  * When I downloaded the file collected through the Google Accounts, I discovered that I actually didn't contain any browser history data but had interesting JSON data file of all autofills and search engine data that seemed to have saved on to the account user information itself.
