# Dear Data

This week, [Jaekook](https://github.com/kook101) and I decided to do a Dear Data week on the theme of "Commute". We allowed ourselves to interpret the theme on our own and I decided to take note of the seating arrangements of the rows of seats around me. Because I often ride the R line of subway, I usually find myself seated and I thought it would be interesting to see what comes out of taking note of who is sitting around me.

I started collecting data from Tuesday February 5th until Sunday February 10th, but since I didn't ride the subway on Sunday, I have 5 days worth of data. I've noted the time that I arrived at a train station, how much the wait time was until I got on the subway as well as what station I departed from.

I've collected the data using the Notes iOS app and its the table drawing tool.

## Raw Data

There are two sorts of seating arrangements that are found typically on the MTA subway. One type of seating arrangements are two L shaped seats facing each other with 3 seats along the car walls / windows and 2 seats perpendicularly situated next to the row of 3-seater (Type 1). The other type of seating arrangement has rows of seats along thecar walls / windows that usually seats 3 people between vertical metal bars (Type 2).

With the different seating arrangement in mind, I've categorized these seats as below: 
* My Row: The row of seats that I'm also seating on.
* Row Adjacent: The row of two seats perpendicularly next to my row of seats. When written *none* in the entry, it indicates that I was sitting / standing in a car that had the "Type 2" seating arrangement as described above.
* Row Across: The row of three seats directly across from my row of seats.
* Row Diagonal: The row of two seats perpendicularly next to row across. When written *none* in the entry, it indicates that I was sitting / standing in a car that had the "Type 2" seating arrangement as described above.

## Result



## Reflection
Before starting to collect data on Tuesday, I thought carefully about the tool that I was going to use to collect my data. I thought about using pen and paper, but I quickly decided against it as I often find it quite difficult to pull out pen and paper in the subway, especially to write. Given the nature of the data I wanted to collect, I thought all I needed was the Notes application, which I use quite frequently to do quick note taking when I am on the move. 

I found myself quite "on alert" the past week in the subway because I would usually try to make use of my time during my commute, usually reading and listening to music. Because I had to keep track of the changing scene around me, I couldn't really do any activities that involved keeping my eyes focused on one particular place.
