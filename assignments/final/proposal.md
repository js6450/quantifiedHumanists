# What Do My Feelings Look Like?

For my final project, I am planning on recording my emotions through images. Images that I capture embody emotions, either the feelings that prompted me to capture the moment or what I feel when looking at the image itself. I would like to keep track of my feelings by representing them as images.

I would like to use the data that I will collect to create a digital painting that represent a summary of the recorded feelings.

## Background Research:

I searched with the term "image sentiment analysis", as this is what I am basically planning to do without the aid of machine learning. 
* Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image sentiment analysis
* [Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis of Images](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/7476/projects/Aditi_Vasavi.pdf), Vasavi Gajarla and Aditi Gupta
* [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

## Hypothesis / Definition of questions:

* Are there similiarities in images 

## Goals:

I am hoping to 

## Sketches / Technical Considerations:

* Basic Shortcuts app that uploads an image and its emotion word.
* Database that stores all the images and the associated keywords.
* Server that extracts aspects of the images that will be used to create the digital painting of emotions.
*
